obtain-android-screenshot
===
This is a small skill I used with [kimi-cli](github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli/) to develop Jetpack Compose components. It instructs the models to check the screenshots of the component previews so that they can improve their code.

It works nicely with the `kimi-for-coding` model with media input capabilities. It should also work with other coding models if they can understand images.
